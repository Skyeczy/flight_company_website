# flight_company_website
In this project, a booking system for a flight company is built. Using this system, customers can search for flights (one way or round trip), purchase flights ticket, view their future flight status or see their past flights, etc. There will be three types of users of this system â€“ Customers, Booking Agents and Airline Staff (Administrator). Booking Agents will book flights for other Customers, can get a fixed commission. They can view their monthly reports and get the total commission. Airline Staff will add new airplanes, create new flights, and update flight status. In general, this will be a simple air ticket reservation system. The project is realized with Python, MySQL, and HTML.
